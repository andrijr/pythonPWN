        python thermometers

        idea: read data from various thermometers
        
        reality: we have one dallas 18s20 connected via 1wire what is mostly used on  RaspberryPi
        
        PULL REQUEST FOR ANOTHER DEVICES ARE WELCOME
        
        supported logger
        ----------------
        
        'thermometer.d18s20.w1' write data from thermometer to logger as list of values, this allow to use i.e. fluent for
        store data into graphite or another type of data storage.
        
        
        instalation
        ------------
        ```
        pip install thermometer
        
        ```
        
        basic usage
        -----------
        measured values are in degrees of Celsius
        
        ```
        >>> from thermometer.dallas_18s20 import w1
        >>> w = w1.dallas_18s20()
        >>> w.get_temps_aliases()
        [('870155007fff0c108a', 24.437), ('080255007fff0c10a5', 32.5)]
        
        ```
        
        
        alias usage
        -----------
        measured values are in degrees of Celsius
        
        ```
        >>> from thermometer.dallas_18s20 import w1
        >>> w = w1.dallas_18s20()
        >>> w.alias('870155007fff0c108a', 'temp1')
        >>> w.get_temps_aliases()
        [('temp1', 24.437), ('080255007fff0c10a5', 32.5)]
        
        ```
        
        Note about Dallas 18S20 and 18B20
        ---------------------------------
        
        during development I found out there are two Dallas thermometers 18S20 and 18B20
         - *DS18S20* High-Precision 1-Wire Digital Thermometer, 10.000010EF0000
         - *DS18B20* Programmable Resolution 1-Wire Digital Thermometer, 28.000028D70000
        
        
        so far name was badly chosen, for 18s20 it was wrong, regarding historical instalations I decide to let it be.
